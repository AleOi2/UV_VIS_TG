# UV_VIS_TG


This repository contains pythonic code for performing analysis on UV-vis absorption data to determine the glass transition of semicrystalline conjugated polymers.

.CSV files containing UV-vis data should be named as follows:

P3BT_25_3.CSV

Here P3BT is the name of the conjugated polymer under investigation,

25 is the annealing temperature in Celsius. (25C corresponds to the as-cast film).

3 is the film number (for uncertainty quantification).
